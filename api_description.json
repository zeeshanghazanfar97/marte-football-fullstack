This will be updated once the competition has started.\n\n> You can find all the leagues ids on our [Dashboard](https://dashboard.api-football.com/soccer/ids).\n\n**Example :**\n```\n\"coverage\": {\n  \"fixtures\": {\n      \"events\": true,\n      \"lineups\": true,\n      \"statistics_fixtures\": false,\n      \"statistics_players\": false\n  },\n  \"standings\": true,\n  \"players\": true,\n  \"top_scorers\": true,\n  \"top_assists\": true,\n  \"top_cards\": true,\n  \"injuries\": true,\n  \"predictions\": true,\n  \"odds\": false\n}\n\n```\nIn this example we can deduce that the competition does not have the following features: `statistics_fixtures`, `statistics_players`, `odds` because it is set to `False`.\n\nThe coverage of a competition can vary from season to season and values set to `True` do not guarantee 100% data availability.\n\nSome competitions, such as the `friendlies`, are exceptions to the coverage indicated in the `leagues` endpoint, and the data available may differ depending on the match, including livescore, events, lineups, statistics and players.\n\nCompetitions are automatically renewed by the API when a new season is available. There may be a delay between the announcement of the official calendar and the availability of data in the API.\n\nFor `Cup` competitions, fixtures are automatically added when the two participating teams are known. For example if the current phase is the 8th final, the quarter final will be added once the teams playing this phase are known.\n\n> Examples available in Request samples \"Use Cases\".\n\n> Most of the parameters of this endpoint can be used together.\n\n**Update Frequency** : This endpoint is updated several times a day.\n\n**Recommended Calls** : 1 call per hour.",
